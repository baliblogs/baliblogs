we should never forget that amitabh bachann was one of the firstpeople responsible for the start of 1984 riots . just after the death of mrs indira gandhi amitabh bachann provoked the mob by saying out loud khoon ka badla khoon (blood for blood) which worked as a fire starter and soon that fire burned the great city of delhi red into the blood of its own people. he should be held as responsible as  we hold jagdish tytler and kamal nath for this massacre. A case must also be filled against him in the court against him in india and prosecuted accordingly. ///it have been 36 years and no main culprit of 84 is behind the bars and they are all roaming free without any fear . The relatives of the people killed during this massacre are begging justice and they are not being listened at all .Bjp before coming to power promised for justice .6 years on and nothing much have been done. its not only about 1984 sikh riots but about any riots that have occured in this country in the last 70 years . let it be 2002 gujarat riots, 1989 kashmiri pandit dispora,1992 babri masjid case,punjab violence,northeast violence,1947  riots violence ,ajmer sharif bomb blast , muzzafarnagar riots,93 bombay riots, 2013 canning riots bengal , 1983 nellie massacre, 1984 biwandi riots,2018 bihar riots, 2020 delhi riots and a long list goes on . when will there be the dawn of justice . when will be able to say that india is a secular country???? when will another bhagat singh come again, when will shivaji come again. i donot know when .But i think we just cannot sit in peace and wait for the change to happen. weapon was never the way and never will be . peace is the only way .we just cannot sit like this atleast i cannot. i have to do something and will do. hope the same from you.
yours sincerely
